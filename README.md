## Overview

Rumor has it that the ultra-wealthy community consists of either investment bankers or entrepreneurs in the tech industry who dropped out of college. Is that stereotype really true? Ever wondered if the top billionaires in the world share anything in common? Although we can't say with certainty what it takes to be one, we do have a way to determine if any patterns exist among the richest people in the world.

In this notebook, we will explore Kernel Principal Component Analysis (Kernel PCA) - an extension of principal component analysis (PCA) - to extract key feature patterns in high-dimensional datasets. In addition to analyzing billionaires around the globe, we will also use this unsupervised learning technique to denoise images.
